alejandro.villamarin@tecnalia.com


TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
**********************

You should have installed ant and Java in order to make this project run. Otherwise you can use the ant provided in the /lib folder.
Besides this obvious ones, there are other libraries required:

* fpt.ant.task_1.1.1.jar
* fpt4j-1.6.1.jar
* log4j-1.2.9.jar
* vsftpclient_1.1.1.jar

Worry not, since all these are already in the /lib folder and the ant script has been configured so its classpath uses them. If you
want to use another version of those, keep in mind to modify classpath references in the script too.


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
******************

There are several ant tasks to test the custom ant task ftp.ant.task. These test will cover:

* upload-dir: Uploads dir /tmp/uploads to the one specified in property ${dest.dir} NOTE: Make sure ${dest.dir} exists, otherwise this will fail
* download-dir: Downloads dir specified in property ${dest.dir} to /tmp/downloads
* delete-file: Deletes file named foo from dir specified in property ${dest.dir}
* upload-file: Uploads file named foo from /tmp/uploads to dir specified in property ${dest.dir}
* download-file: Downloads file named foo from dir specified in property ${dest.dir} to /tmp/downloads
* delete-dir: Deletes dir specified in property ${dest.dir}
* test-ftp-ant-task: Runs all test in the order specified
* ftp-init: Initializes everything, required before running anything else

Simply run test-ftp-ant-task from Eclipse or a shell and that should do it
