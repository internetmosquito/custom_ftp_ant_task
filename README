Introduction
************

This library implements a customized Ant task used to upload/download files from a FTP server using
a client ftp library named vsftpclient, which also wraps basic FTP client functionalities of the 
ftp4j library. Whenever you need to communicate with a FTP server in your Ant file and the default
FTP Ant task is not working (which was my case) you could use this.

At master you will find 2 folders:

custom-ftp-ant-task
custom-ftp-ant-task-test

First one is the ant task itself
Second one is a test project for the ant task, so you can try it out straight away
